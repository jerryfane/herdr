//! Bounded per-pane raw PTY output ring for the `pane.stream` firehose.
//!
//! A single producer (the PTY reader thread, via `process_pty_bytes` while it
//! already holds the terminal core lock) appends raw pre-parser bytes here.
//! One or more stream server threads drain the ring through independent
//! cursors. The ring is deliberately bounded: when the slowest consumer cannot
//! keep up the writer never blocks and never grows memory. Instead the oldest
//! bytes are evicted; a consumer whose cursor has fallen off the retained
//! window is told to `Lagged` and the server re-seeds it with a single
//! full-screen keyframe (snapshot-collapse resync).
//!
//! Correctness of the seed/resume boundary depends on the byte-offset advance
//! and the terminal screen mutation happening inside the *same* core-lock
//! critical section (see `PaneTerminal::process_pty_bytes` and
//! `PaneTerminal::output_snapshot`), so a captured `(visible_ansi, offset)`
//! pair is always a consistent cut with no gap or overlap.
